				<h1>Guidelines</h1>
				<p>
					We ask that everyone follow these below guidelines. Depending on the
					severity or how many times an individual has broken the rules they may
					be temporarily or permanently removed from the chatroom at the
					discretion of the SOPs (moderators).
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The SOPs maintain the final decision on what is or isn't appropriate
						for main. If you're asked to change the subject or refrain from a
						behavior, please remember that their job is to keep the channel safe
						for everybody and their request isn't personal.
					</li>
					<li>
						For legal reasons everyone must be at least 13 years of age, and we
						reserve the right to ask anyone under 14 to seek help elsewhere.
					</li>
					<li>
						Get permission in main before PMing (private messaging) others. The
						only exception to this is that you may PM a SOP regarding a
						guideline violation without asking permission first, and the SOP
						will help you if they are able. A SOP may likewise PM any member
						regarding a guideline issue without prior permission.
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid using descriptors that are likely to be triggering, including
						but not limited to:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Descriptions of self-injury such as: what it looks like, how
								many times, the tool used, etc.
							</li>
							<li>
								Overly violent language or detailed descriptions of abuse.
							</li>
							<li>Numbers regarding weight, clothing sizes, or calories.</li>
							<li>
								Specific amounts, or methods pertaining to drug or substance
								abuse.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you need to discuss issues in more detail, don't be afraid to
								ask someone to PM (private message) you. Just get permission and
								check that they're okay with the subject matter first.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not interfere with the supportive environment of the room.
						Actions such as: spamming, harassing or insulting others, name
						calling, making derogatory remarks, or mocking someone discussing
						their issues are absolutely not allowed. This is not an exhaustive
						list — just don't be a jerk.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not make threats or announcements that you're going to hurt (or
						kill) yourself or others.
					</li>
					<li>Do not self-injure whilst in the channel.</li>
					<li>
						Sexual content is prohibited: including jokes, innuendo, sexual
						behavior, etc. Please keep in mind that many people have sexual
						abuse issues and that there are minors in the chat.
					</li>
					<li>
						Discussions on religion and politics are discouraged since they tend
						to start fights.
					</li>
					<li>Be respectful.</li>
					<li>
						This is meant to be a community based on trust, so please don't lie
						or fabricate events. If you're uncomfortable answering a question
						just say you'd rather not respond.
					</li>
					<li>
						Please choose a nickname that is not offensive, derogatory, SI
						(self-injury), ED (eating disorder), or drug related. If a SOP asks
						you to change your nick, don't be offended — just change to
						something more neutral.
					</li>
					<li>
						Please do not share things that are said in chat with others outside
						of #bus.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you need help or are upset and want to talk, try to say so
						openly. No one will know how you're feeling unless you tell them,
						and trying to hint at it to get people to ask more is generally
						ineffective. Ultimately, you're responsible for communicating what
						you need.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p>
					If your conversation is making others uncomfortable, you may be asked
					to take the discussion to <strong>#elsewhere</strong>; if this
					happens, the conversation is to end in the main chat. You can join the
					room by typing <strong>/join #elsewhere</strong>.
					<br />
					<br />
					<em
						>Note: This is for civil conversations that may need to be moved out
						of main. It is NOT for fighting, graphic descriptions of self harm,
						pro-selfharm/suicide talk, etc.</em
