			<h3>Welcome to the #bus Mental Health Support Chat</h3>
			<p>
				Need to talk? Come join us! We are a mental health support chat for
				those struggling with mental illness, the stress in their lives, or self
				harm. We are a community of people who listen and support each other.
				<br />
				<br />
				The members of BUS are not professionals. If you are in suicidal crisis,
				please contact a crisis resource, your doctor, or local emergency
				services.
			</p>
			<h3>A Few Things First</h3>
			<p>
				We hope to maintain a safe and supportive environment in the chat. To
				that end, we do have some guidelines here. We ask everyone to read these
				before they join the chat.
				<br />
				<br />
				We operate on a discord server. For legal reasons, you must be at least
				13 years old to use the chatroom. If you are under 13, we encourage you
				to discuss your struggles with a teacher, doctor, parent, friend’s
				parent, or adult you trust.
				<br />
				<br />
				We have members from all over the world and the activity level ebbs and
				flows over the course of the day. If it’s quiet when you join, we’d urge
				you to stick around for a bit or try again later.
			</p>
			<h5>Come chat with us in Discord.</h5>
			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
				#bus is a peer-support chatroom that was founded in 1996 as a safe,
				anonymous place for those struggling with self-injury or mental health
				issues to vent, seek advice, and feel a sense of community with others
				who understand. This site originated from another online community also
				named BUS, or Bodies Under Siege, which was a peer support resource for
				people who self harm. For many years, the online IRC chat room and the
				forum were operated together, but eventually the chat became its own
				entity. In time, the chat has evolved from strictly a self-harm support
				room to a place where anyone struggling with mental health issues can
				talk.
				<br />
				<br />
				We consider ourselves to be a pro-recovery chatroom; however you do not
				have to be ready to make changes to join #bus, and many of our members
				aren’t. Within the “pro-recovery” mindset, we ask that you not actively
				discourage others from stopping unhealthy practices or seeking help.
				<br />
				<br />
				The website and chatroom is run by volunteers.
