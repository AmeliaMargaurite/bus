				<h1>Self-Harm Alternatives</h1>
				<h3>When the Urge Hits</h3>

					Try to identify the problem and see if you can come up with a
					different solution.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						H.A.L.T. Some common things can be found in the HALT acronym -

						any point in your life. Add subpoints if applicable.
					</li>
					<li>

				<h2>Before the Urge Hits</h2>
				<h3>Make a plan and reduce triggers:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Make a list of reasons you want to stop self-harming. Keep a copy
						with your tools, and/or any other place you think it might be useful
						to have a copy.
					</li>
					<li>Throw out your tools</li>
					<li>
						If you choose to keep your tools, make them harder to access: put
						them in a box, and wrap the box in a bunch of layers of tape, or
						hide them someplace that takes several steps to access.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make a rule that you will never self-harm in the bathroom, and stick
						to it. At some point when you're trying to stop, you will want to
						self-harm and need to use the bathroom. If you associate your
						bathroom with self-harm, it will make that much more difficult.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designate a safe spot: one that you will not self-harm in, or keep
						anything dangerous in, no matter what. This might be your bed,
						bedroom, a favorite chair, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to figure out times of the day or events that are especially
						difficult for you and come up with a plan to deal with them
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep a calendar especially for your SI. Put a sticker or star on
						each day that you are SI-free. At the end of each week look back at
						which days you hurt yourself. Try to beat that next week. If you get
						a month full of stickers, buy yourself a treat, like a new book or
						movie or something
					</li>
					<li>
						Plan out some sort of rewards system for milestones - like one day
						without self-injury, one week without self-injury, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						Carry “safe” objects in your pockets or purse when entering a
						stressful situation. These might be stones, crystals, small stuffed
						animals, squishy stress relievers, etc. Whatever feels right to you
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Work on changing your perspective:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Whenever anyone pays you a compliment, thanks you, or says something
						nice about you, write that down. Reread them all when you feel down
						or bad about yourself.
					</li>
					<li>
						Give yourself permission to not be perfect (Afterall, no one is!)
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to focus more on the positive things in life - at the end of the
						day, write down good things that happened or things you did well at.
					</li>
					<li>Find a place to volunteer or way to help others</li>
					<li>
						Be kind to yourself. You don't deserve to be bullied, even by
						yourself
					</li>
					<li>
						Remember that the only person's actions you can control are you own
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Make a crisis box:</h3>
				<p>
					A crisis box contains things to help you when you want to self-harm or
					are feeling panicky/low. It doesn't have to be a box, it can be a bag
					or drawer or whatever works for you. Ultimately what you put in your
					box is a highly personal matter, but here are some ideas that others
					have found helpful:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strong tasting candies, like altoid mints</li>
					<li>
						A list of phone numbers you can call (friends, family, your
						therapist, crisis lines, etc.)
					</li>
					<li>A comforting smelling perfume or lotion</li>
					<li>A favorite dvd/cd</li>
					<li>A stuffed animal</li>
					<li>Pictures with friends/family of good memories</li>
					<li>
						Notes or letters from loved ones that make you feel valued and loved
						(or print outs of text conversations/emails/facebook messages, etc.)
					</li>
					<li>Your list of reasons not to self harm</li>
					<li>
						A personalized list of alternatives to self-harm that have worked
						for you in the past
					</li>
					<li>A coloring book and crayons/colored pencils</li>
					<li>A puzzle book</li>
					<li>A craft kit</li>
					<li>Nail polish</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Take care of your health</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Exercise regularly - It decreases stress and anxiety and increases
						energy
					</li>
					<li>
						Meditate and/or do deep breathing exercises on a regular basis
					</li>
					<li>
						Eat a healthy and balanced diet. Your body has a basic need for
						nutrients. A poor or inadequate diet keeps your body and brain from
						functioning at their best, and may increase stress, anxiety,
						irritability, or a number of other issues that could lead to wanting
						to self-harm.
					</li>
					<li>Drink enough water</li>
					<li>
						Get enough sleep, and if possible go to sleep and wake at the same
						times each day
					</li>
					<li>
						Go outside in the sun for 15 minutes every day. If 15 minutes is too
						daunting, start with 30 seconds, or whatever seems doable to you,
						and try to work up
					</li>
					<li>
						Talk to a doctor, even if you don't bring up the self-harm right
						away. Getting treatment for any underlying issues such as depression
						or anxiety can, for many people, reduce the urge to self-harm. Of
						course, it's best to tell the doctor about everything (including the
						self-injury) as doctors can help you best when they understand the
						whole problem
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid alcohol and mood altering drugs (aside from prescription
						medication taken as your doctor instructs)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Redirect your thinking:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Make a containment box. A containment box is something that can be
						done mentally or physically. The goal is to create a place where you
						can store uncomfortable memories until you are better able to deal
						with them. Some people like to visualize the box in their mind and
						see the memory go in there. Other people prefer to make an actual
						container out of a shoe-box or something and write their memories
						down on a piece of paper and put it away in the box. Do whichever
						appeals most to you. All you're really trying to do is set aside
						what is overwhelming until you are equipped to deal with it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Act happy. Smile, deliberately put a jauntiness into your step, put
						on an alert, interested expression, make yourself talk cheerfully to
						people, hum or whistle a cheerful tune - often, when we ACT like we
						feel good, we start FEELING good.
					</li>
					<li>
						Visualize a “stop” sign and symbolically disallow those thoughts to
						continue. And then actively choose to start thinking about something
						else. This takes practice, but the more you do it the better you'll
						get.
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice positive thinking. Repeat positive things such as “I am a
						good person who doesn't deserve to be hurt.” When you start thinking
						negative things about yourself, say the positive equivalent to
						yourself, even if you don't believe it. Those negative thoughts can
						become habitual, so can positive ones.
					</li>
