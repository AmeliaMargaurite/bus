				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					In spite of the title, <em>there is no shame here</em>. If you cause
					physical harm to your body in order to deal with overwhelming
					feelings, know that you have nothing to be ashamed of. It's likely
					that you're keeping yourself alive and maintaining psychological
					integrity with the only tool you have right now. It's a crude and
					ultimately self-destructive tool, but it works; you get relief from
					the overwhelming pain/fear/anxiety in your life. The prospect of
					giving it up may be unthinkable, which makes sense; you may not
					realize that self-harm isn't the only or even best coping method
					around.
					<br />
					<br />
					For many people who self-injure, though, there comes a breakthrough
					moment when they realize that change is possible, that they can
					escape, that things can be different. They begin to believe that other
					tools do exist and begin figuring out which of these
					non-self-destructive ways of coping work for them. This site exists to
					help you come closer to that moment.
					<br />
					<br />
					How do you know if you self-injure? It may seem an odd question to
					some, but a few people aren't sure if what they do is "really"
					self-injury. Answer these questions:
					<br />
					<br />
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Do you deliberately cause physical harm to yourself to the extent of
						causing tissue damage (breaking the skin, bruising, leaving marks
						that last for more than an hour)?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you cause this harm to yourself as a way of dealing with
						unpleasant or overwhelming emotions, thoughts, or situations
						(including dissociation)?
					</li>
					<li>
						If your self-harm is not compulsive, do you often think about SI
						even when you're relatively calm and not doing it at the moment?
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					If you answer #1 and #2 yes, you are a self-injurer. If you answer #3
					yes, you are most likely a repetitive self-injurer. The way you choose
					to hurt yourself could be cutting, hitting, burning, scratching,
					skin-picking, banging your head, breaking bones, not letting wounds
					heal, among others. You might do several of these. How you injure
					yourself isn't as important as recognizing that you do and what it
					means in your life.

					<br />
					<br />
					Self-injurious behavior does not necessarily mean you were an abused
					child. It usually indicates that somewhere along the line, you didn't
					learn good ways of coping with overwhelming feelings. You're not a
					disgusting or sick; you just never learned positive ways to deal with
					your feelings.
					<br />
					<br />
					Please try to make yourself safe before proceeding; some of these
					pages contain material that may temporarily intensify the urge to
					self-harm in some people. If you are struggling with the impulse to
					self-injure right now, you may want to skip directly to the
					<a href="" target="_blank">self-help</a
					><!-- @TODO -->
					section. If you're new to the concept of self-injury and don't know
					where to start, try this <a href="" target="_blank">quick primer</a>
					<!-- @TODO -->
					on SI. The primer is also useful if you find some of the other pages
					here too technical.
